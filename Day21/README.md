ML_Docker Project
----------------
Overview
----------------

This project demonstrates an ML model that predicts outputs based on input data.

The main objective is to learn and practice ML model development, containerization, and deployment.

Steps Followed
----------------

1. Setting up the Environment
   ----------------
   
    Installed Python and created a virtual environment.
   
    Installed required libraries, including the scikit-learn library, for machine learning.
   
3. Writing the ML Code
   ----------------
   
    Developed a script for training a simple ML model.

    The script used a dataset to train the model and predict outputs.

3. Dockerizing the Application
   ----------------
   
    Created a Dockerfile to containerize the project.

    Set up the environment in the container and included the ML script.

    Built and ran the container to ensure it worked correctly.

4. Testing
   ----------------
   
    Verified the predictions generated by the model to ensure correctness.

5. Version Control
   ----------------
   
    Initialized a Git repository to track the project.
  
    Committed the project files and pushed them to a GitHub repository.
  
Technologies Used
----------------

    Python for developing the ML model.

    scikit-learn for training and testing the ML model.
    
    Docker for containerization.
    
    GitHub for version control and collaboration.
